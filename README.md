# Ceasar cypher

### Application created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript

App can be found [here](https://annageorg.github.io/CaesarCipher/)

Add text on the top to cypher and choose your encryption key. Encrypted text is then diplayed on the box below.
Decrypting a text uses the same logic as above, just the input is on the bottom and decrypted text appears on the top box.
